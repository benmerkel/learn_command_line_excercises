The pwd command returns the following:
/Users/benmerkel/workspace/davinci_coders_t2_2014/learn_command_line_excercises/chapter_2

The above is the same path or hierarchy you follow when using the graphical interface
to navigate to the same file or directory.  First you would open your 'Finder' and click
on 'benmerkel' under favorites which essentially takes you to /Users/benmerkel.  From 
here, you just follow the order of opening workspace, then davinci... until you get to 
the chapter_2 folder.

Also, I typed pwd well over 40 times.
