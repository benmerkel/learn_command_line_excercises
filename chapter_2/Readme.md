The pwd command returns the following:
/Users/benmerkel/workspace/davinci_coders_t2_2014/learn_command_line_excercises/chapter_2

Alternative english questions:
1) What directory are you in?
A. I'm in the chapter_2 directory under learn_command_line_excercises

2) Are you in the class directory?
A. No, I'm in a subdirectory of the class folder

3) Are you your home directory 
A. No, I'm not in my home directory.

4) What directory did you run that cammand in
A. I ran that command in the chapter_2 directory

The above is the same path or hierarchy you follow when using the graphical interface
to navigate to the same file or directory.  First you would open your 'Finder' and click
on 'benmerkel' under favorites which essentially takes you to /Users/benmerkel.  From 
here, you just follow the order of opening workspace, then davinci... until you get to 
the chapter_2 folder.

Also, I typed pwd well over 40 times.
